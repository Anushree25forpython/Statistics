# Bridge regression

Prediction of Bridge Condition using Regression Model -


Built a regression-based model to predict bridge condition ratings for the Texas Department of Transportation using predictors including age, average usage, truck traffic, material and design. 
Performed feature engineering (e.g. deriving age), variable transformation, correlation, and residual evaluation to assess model effectiveness and predictor impact.
