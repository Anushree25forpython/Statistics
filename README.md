# 🚀 Project Title - Bridge regression

## 📌 Overview
Built a regression-based model to predict bridge condition ratings for the Texas Department of Transportation using predictors including age, average usage, truck traffic, material and design. 
Performed feature engineering (e.g. deriving age), variable transformation, correlation, and residual evaluation to assess model effectiveness and predictor impact.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
To investigate/understand how well the proposed variables can predict the bridge condition and which of the proposed variables has more influence on the current condition.

## 📊 Dataset
- File: `tx19_bridges_sample.csv`
- Source: (National Bridge Inspection - https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/nbi/ascii.cfm )
- Columns: Age (derived from variable Year - The year the bridge was built subtrcating the current year), AverageDaily - the average daily traffic (number of vehicles)), Trucks_percent - The percent of traffic made up of 'trucks' (i.e. lorries), Material - The dominant material the bridge is made from, variable Design - The design of the bridge, current condition - derived from variables Deck_rating (condition of the deck of the bridge), Superstr_rating (condition of the bridge superstructure) and Substr_rating ((condition of the bridge substructure (foundations)).
